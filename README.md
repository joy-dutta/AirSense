# AirQualityMonitoring
Citizens are exposed to air pollutants both indoors and outdoors due to their activities, which may result in a variety of health effects. Thus, monitoring and understanding air quality is of great concern to all of us. In this work, we have explored both indoor and outdoor air quality for the betterment of humanity and the proper realization of the smart city. Some of our published research articles are listed below:
